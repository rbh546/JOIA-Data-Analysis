# JOIA-Data-Analysis
The repository contains the code for JOIA data analysis and visualization

The details for JOIA tests can be found here (Sodhi, D. S., Takeuchi, T., Nakazawa, N., Akagawa, S., and Saeki, H., 1998, “Medium-Scale Indentation Tests on Sea Ice at Various Speeds,” Cold Reg. Sci. Technol., 28(3), pp. 161–182 DOI: 10.1016/S0165-232X(98)00017-2.)

The repository contains the scripts for the GUI tool for data visualization and analysis for high-pressure zones. Some of the functions were borrowed from work of Martin Richard, NRC, Canada. The data files are too large to upload in GitHub. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested about this work
